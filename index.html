<p> This website will show the soviet invasion of afghanistan during the cold war by aadam hmaidi</p>
<h2> The cold war</h2>
<p> When Nazi Germany surrendered in 1945 to the US britain france and the USSR the allies split Germany up into two nations west germany belonging to britain france and the US. East  germany belonging to the USSR. After 1945 the USA and the USSR saw each other as a threat due to their ideologies communism and capitalism. And both nations were competing each other in arms races, Space, science, economics, technology and even nuclear capabilities. After WW2 NATO (north atlantic treaty organisation a military alliance in europe) was founded with USA, Britain and France as the founded countries and nations in europe began to join NATO however the soviet union saw this as a threat and formed the Warsaw Pact (countries in east europe ) to counter NATO expansion.</p>
 This was called the cold war or the iron curtain where millions of people in europe and America was fearing of America and the USSR would have a nuclear war both sides were watching one another waiting for either country to make a move that would start world war three. During the last days of the cold war the Soviet 40th army invaded afghanistan in order to make it a communist puppet nation.</p>
 <p> During the cold war there were a series of wars particularly in Asia where America and the USSR would intervene behind the scenes. An example of this is the 1955 vietnam war where the North vietnamese communist army invaded south vietnam. North vietnam was supported by the USSR and communist china and south vietnam was supported by america. During this conflict millions of people in north vietnam was inspired by Ho chi Minh to resist the Americans. This resistance was called the Vietcong where they would use tunnels to sabotage American supply lines and conduct ambushes as these members were civilians it was hard for the Americans to track them as they sucessfully blended in with the populations in south vietnam. Despite American troops and weapons in vietnam the outcome was the north vietnamese army emerging victorious and annexing south vietnam unifing it and creating all of vietnam in a communist nation. </p>
 <p> Another example is the Korean war where North Korea (supported by USSR and china) invaded south Korea. As America was allied with south korea sent its troops and a combination of British, French, Australian West German and canadian soldiers to fight in south Korea against the North koreans. The allied armies pushed the North koreans to the chinese Border where the chinese fearing of America invading China next sent 55,000 soldiers to push the allied armies. The commander of the allied army Douglas McArthur requested authorization to atom bomb Beijing but US Patrick Trueman refused to give the order most likely because it could escalate the conflict and get the soviets involved. The fighting ended due to an armistice Between the north and south korean border there is a demilitarized zone if either side crosses it it could start a war. Even up to this day the Americans are allies with the south Koreans. South Korea today follows America`s democracy and capitalism whereas, the North Koreans still has a nation that looks like the 20th century infrastructure and lifestyle.</p>
 
<h2> Soviet manipulation of British intelligence during the cold war.</h2>
<p> In the 20th century the soviet union was successful in establishing one of the largest and successful spy networks in the world stretching from russia to europe and America. They were experts in manipulating memebers of foreign military intelligence giving them money and brainwashing them of communism making them believe communism was better than capitalism. The soviets were responsible for influencing key members of british intelligence MI6 making them soviet spies inside MI6. These men were called the Cambridge five most likely becuse they studied at Cambridge university before they were recruited in MI6. As these men were at the top of MI6 they had access to all the classified information. They sold a lot of secrets to the soviets damaging the security of great britain and killed a lot of undercover british agents either in Asia or Europe and released a lot of information about the American intelligence operations. These men were eventually discovered by the american intelligence who then tipped the british and the soviets quickly smuggled them to the soviet union where they would live in Moscow for the rest of their lives. The final member died in 2021 ending their spy ring. This spy network within Great Britain was a colossal faliure for british intelligence and led to reforms and reorganising inside MI6 and MI5</p>

 <h2> Russian 40th army invasion of Afghanistan</h2>
 <p> The soviet government under Leonid Brezhnev selected the russian 40th infantry army to invade afganistan in full force.</p>
 <p>During the invasion the 40th army was accussed of conducting war crimes against the local populations of afganistan mass murderings and genocide claiming it was to surpress afghan resistance. There were rumours of chemical weapons used in afghanistan as well.</p>
 <p> During the invasion. The KGB and GRU Russian military intelligence services was responsible of the assassination of the president of afganistan Nur Muhammad Taraki by sending russain commandos (spetsnaz) in his palace (this was called operation storm 333) where the russians placed Babrak karmal to be the communist puppet president of afganistan. With this the afghan army surrendered and victory was in sight for the soviets.</p>
<p> Western nations especially America condemed the USSR of its invasion insituting a trade embargo and sanctions. The Russian invasion also caused a sense of alarm for Afganistan`s next door neighbor Pakistan as they were afraid that if the soviets were successful in Afganistan they would set their sights on Pakistan.  Britain feared that Russia sought access to the Indian Ocean, and posed a threat to Western security, explicitly violating the world balance of power agreed upon at Yalta in 1945. Even communist China condemned the Soviets military for the invasion, calling it a threat to Chinese security (both the Soviet Union and Afghanistan shared borders with China)</p>

<h2> The mujahideen</h2>
<p>With the Afghan government and armed forces eliminated the soviets presumed they were victorious. However, groups of muslim religious and political tribes who saw the soviets as a threat united together to resist the Russians.
these freedom fighters were called the mujahideen. The mujahideen in Arabic means Jihad holy war these groups saw the invasion of afganistan a threat to Islam so the main reason they resisted the Soviets was because the Soviets were eradicating Islam in Afganistan.</p>
<p>Operating in the mountains the mujahideen conducted a guerilla warface against the soviets. The mujahideen received countless support Islamic nations and anti communist nations such as America Pakistan Saudi Arabia and England all of these nations providing them with western weapons, explosives communication, equiptment, finances, and combat training. As afganistan is a nation of mountains it was impossible for the soviets to use their tanks and infantry. So they relied on helicopters and the air force to maintain air supeiority and destroy mujahideen camps and bases.</p>
America may have aided the mujahideen could be to get revenge on the Soviet`s involvement in the korean and vietnamese war.</p>

<h2> Soviet defeat, withdrawal and aftermath</h2>
<p>As the mujahideen got western weapons such as the infamous US Javelin missile they could destroying soviet aircraft and got training from the Central intelligence agency (CIA) They concentrated on both civilian and military targets, knocking out bridges, closing major roads, attacking convoys, disrupting the electric power system and industrial production, and attacking police stations and Soviet military installations and air bases. They assassinated government officials and PDPA members who collaborated with the Soviets, and laid siege to small rural outposts. And conducted sabotage operations on soviet supply lines. </p>
<p> The director of ther CIA William casey even encouraged the mujahideen to conduct raids in USSR territory. In April 1987, three separate teams of Afghan rebels were directed by the ISI (pakistani intelligence) to launch coordinated violent raids on multiple targets across the Soviet border and extending, in the case of an attack on an Uzbek factory, as deep as over 16 kilometres (10 mi) into Soviet territory. In response, the Soviets issued a thinly-veiled threat to invade Pakistan to stop the cross-border attacks but did little difference.
<p>In response the soviets did a brute force approach to weeding out the insurgency, the Soviets used KHAD ( communist Afghan secret police) to gather intelligence, infiltrate the Mujahideen, they used the Classic search and destroy operations were implemented using Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships that would provide cover for ground forces in armored vehicles. Once the villages were occupied by Soviet forces, inhabitants who remained were frequently interrogated and tortured for information or killed. The soviets attempted to discredit afghan support of the mujahideen by releasing millions of propoganda documents claiming the mujahideen were terrorists.
    Intimidation was the first strategy, in which the Soviets would use airborne attacks and armored ground attacks to destroy villages, livestock and crops in trouble areas. The Soviets would bomb villages that were near sites of guerrilla attacks on Soviet convoys or known to support resistance groups. Local peoples were forced to either flee their homes or die as daily Soviet attacks made it impossible to live in these areas. By forcing the people of Afghanistan to flee their homes, the Soviets hoped to deprive the guerrillas of resources and safe havens. The second strategy consisted of subversion, which entailed sending spies to join resistance groups and report information as well as bribing local tribes or guerrilla leaders into ceasing operations. </p>
<P>When the soviet 40th army withdrawed from afganistan the mujahideen had a civil war with the repubic of afghanistan government which the mujahideen emerged victorious. Then a second civil war began which led to the rise of the Taliban in 1990 where they gained control of most of Afganistan and resulted in the US and UK invasion of Afganistan in 2000 due to the Taliban giving the terrorist organisation called Al- qaeda safe haven in Afganistan after their attack on the US called spetember eleven. This then created the War on Terror.</P>
